        <h1>My dear Noëlie,</h1>
        <p>this message and these flowers, or more specifically tulips, are for you, even if not in their physical form. Before you call me out on this—no, I did not try to copy your idea. You know that I’m the type of person who wants to receive while giving, but I also want to give while I’m receiving. Especially to the people who deserve it. Especially to you.</p>
        <p>Noëlie, you have no idea how much impact you have on my life at the moment. You’ve totally changed my view on everything. You’ve made me want to keep going. For you and also for myself.</p>
        <p>I pay attention to everything you say all the time. I analyze everything. I always try to make you feel understood and wanted. Because you are wanted. I’ve never wanted a person this much in my whole life.</p>
        <p>You're such a sweet person and you're also the most caring person I’ve ever met. I’m not saying this just because you wrote a little message for me yesterday, but because I truly mean it. You’re so kind, so understanding. So talkative with me but a bit shy when it comes to talking to new people. I love listening to you talk. Even if I don’t reply at all, I’m still listening to you. That’s actually the main reason I don’t reply to you talking sometimes. You truly hypnotize me. Especially when you’re talking about the things that you truly love. The things that you’re very interested in. I’m so in love with your voice. In love with you as a whole.</p>
        <p>I don’t think you realize how beautiful you are. Even if you think that you’re not as good-looking in real life, I know that’s not true. I know that you’re gorgeous. In real life and in your pictures. Don’t think that me not sending you a million messages after you send a picture is me not appreciating it or thinking that you’re ugly. That is so not the case. You’re just so breathtaking that I end up losing words. I have no idea what to say whenever I see you. That’s how perfect you are. Everything about you is beautiful. Your hair, that’s just the perfect length. The cute moles on your face. Your beautiful brown eyes with the cutest sparkle in them. Your lips that look so kissable. Your fashion choices. I have never not liked the outfits that you’ve shown me.</p> 
        <p>I wish to love you forever, my Noëlie, and I wish to always be by your side. Even during the hardest times, I want to be there with you. Because I know that we can get through them together. I’m always here for you, even when you think that your struggles are not worth mentioning because you don’t see them as a tragedy. But I do. I want you to be happy. I want you to be the happiest girl in the world because I know that it will make me the happiest guy in the world.</p> 
        <p class="italic-paragraph">"But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,</p>
        <p class="italic-paragraph">All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end."</p>
        <p class="italic-paragraph">William Shakespeare; Sonnet 30</p>
        <p>I hope that you don’t see this whole message as overly corny. I just want you to know how madly in love with you I am.</p>
        <p>- Your Ren.</p>
